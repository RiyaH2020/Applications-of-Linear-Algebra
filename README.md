Applications of Linear Algebra — Faculty Development Program

This repository contains instructional Jupyter notebooks developed as part of a Faculty Development Program (FDP) aimed at helping undergraduate educators connect Linear Algebra concepts to real-world applications in data science, machine learning, NLP, and image processing.

🌱 Overview

These materials were designed to make Linear Algebra more intuitive and relatable by demonstrating how its core ideas power modern computational techniques.
Through hands-on examples, the notebooks cover:

Geometric interpretations of vector spaces, projections, and transformations.

Connections between Linear Algebra and regression models, explaining least squares through vector geometry.

Dimensionality and rank in understanding data and feature spaces.

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors as tools for decomposition and feature extraction.

Applications in image processing, including transformations and rotations using matrices.

NLP-related use cases, such as word embeddings, similarity measures, and cross-domain alignment.

Each topic blends mathematical intuition with Python-based experimentation to help educators illustrate abstract ideas through simple, visual examples.
