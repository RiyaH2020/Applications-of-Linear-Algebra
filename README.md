# Applications of Linear Algebra

This repository contains instructional Jupyter notebooks developed as part of a **Faculty Development Program (FDP)** aimed at helping undergraduate educators connect **Linear Algebra concepts to real-world applications** in data science, machine learning, NLP, and image processing.

## ðŸŒ± Overview

These materials were designed to make Linear Algebra more intuitive and relatable by demonstrating how its core ideas power modern computational techniques.  
Through hands-on examples, the notebooks cover:

- **Geometric interpretations** of vector spaces, projections, and transformations.  
- **Connections between Linear Algebra and regression models**, explaining least squares through vector geometry.  
- **Dimensionality and rank** in understanding data and feature spaces.  
- **Eigenvalues and eigenvectors** as tools for decomposition and feature extraction.  
- **Applications in image processing**, including transformations and rotations using matrices.  
- **NLP-related use cases**, such as word embeddings, similarity measures, and cross-domain alignment.  

Each topic blends mathematical intuition with Python-based experimentation to help educators illustrate abstract ideas through simple, visual examples.
